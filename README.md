## Prerequisites

All skills require OKX API credentials. Apply at [OKX Developer Portal](https://web3.okx.com/onchain-os/dev-portal).

Recommended: create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
OKX_API_KEY="your-api-key"
OKX_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
OKX_PASSPHRASE="your-passphrase"
```

**Security warning**: Never commit `.env` to git (add it to `.gitignore`) and never expose credentials in logs, screenshots, or chat messages.

## Skill Workflows

The skills work together in typical DeFi flows:

**Search and Buy**: `okx-dex-token` (find token) -> `okx-wallet-portfolio` (check funds) -> `okx-dex-swap` (execute trade)

**Portfolio Overview**: `okx-wallet-portfolio` (holdings) -> `okx-dex-token` (enrich with analytics) -> `okx-dex-market` (price charts)

**Market Research**: `okx-dex-token` (trending/rankings) -> `okx-dex-market` (candles/history) -> `okx-dex-swap` (trade)

**Swap and Broadcast**: `okx-dex-swap` (get tx data) -> sign locally -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (broadcast) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (track order)

**Pre-flight Check**: `okx-onchain-gateway` (estimate gas) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (simulate tx) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (broadcast) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (track order)

**Full Trading Flow**: `okx-dex-token` (search) -> `okx-dex-market` (price/chart) -> `okx-wallet-portfolio` (check balance) -> `okx-dex-swap` (get tx) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (simulate + broadcast + track)

**Prediction Market Trading**: `polymarket` (search market) -> `polymarket` (check price) -> `polymarket` (buy shares)

## Install CLI

### Shell Script (macOS / Linux)

Auto-detects your platform, downloads the matching binary, verifies SHA256 checksum, and installs to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/plugin-store-skills/main/install.sh | sh
```
